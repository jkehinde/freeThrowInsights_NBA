# freeThrowInsights_NBA
In this project we look at the top highest paid NBA players from 2005-2015. The aim is calcuate the: 
   *Free Throw Attempts per game 
   * Accuracy of Free Throws
   * Player playing style (2 vs 3 points preference) excluding Free Throws.


BEFORE STARING WORKING WITH 'main.R' RUN 'BasketballTrendsData.R'! in R studio

This will make sure that we have the FieldGoalAttempts, FieldGoals, Games, MinutesPlayed & Salary of each player per season.
Once this is done you can move to 'main.R'.
